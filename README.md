# GeneReefs
the tools that built the GeneReefs art collection. Each GeneReef is a tiny html file that uses a canvas live and could be modded to fit into video games, multi touch screens, etc. Hundreds are on Cardano. Make your own locally.

The html in ReefEditor dir made them all. It takes json as input and output. It also outputs html and zip.
